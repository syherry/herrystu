        Software Engineering Major Li Haiyang

		Abstract: Most of the current graduates still choose to practice before graduation.However, due to the 
		uncertainty of the internship place, the instability of internship work and the disunity of work content 
		of most of the fresh graduates,It may cause some obstacles to the management of the internship of 
		the graduates.The new graduates have stepped out of the campus initially, just entered the society, facing 
		the accelerated pace of life, the pressure of living and the external conditions full of temptation may 
		threaten the psychological, physiological and even personal safety of the graduates.So,The tracking and 
		management system designed for the graduates can facilitate the University's practice, living conditions, 
		work content and learning spirit .Ensure that every fresh graduate's work and life during the internship can
		be protected by our school.The system can perform different operations on the two roles of teacher and student 
		by setting up two parts of counselor management end and student end.Design the overall management function of 
		the class for the counselor.The key function of student end and lies in the report of practice work submit  
		to teacher.Counselors can regularly grasp students' internships,And accurately  the task  of accept each stage.
		Java language is used throughout the project, and the language environment is JDK1.8.Encoding with IntelliJ idea.
		Choose nginx + Tomcat service architecture to realize front and back end separation.Bootstrap framework as the 
		front-end data display framework.Springboot as a back-end business processing framework.Realize specific 
		functions through data processing in MySQL database.
